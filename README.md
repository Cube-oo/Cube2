# Cube2
FPV racing Open Source BOX

Work in progress

This project draws inspiration from a series of other FPV frames that have been successful in recent years, first and foremost the CherryCraft üçí Staccato, which was one of the first Box frames seen in the FPV racing scene.
Another reference is the OSSA by Falcon Multirotors, very similar to the Italian CAPRICCIOSA üçï by SpeedyPizzaDrones; all of these shared a Box structure. Still, in Italy, there‚Äôs another noteworthy frame that caught my attention, the FINZ FPV Fox Crooked ü¶ä... and so, to add another element to the mix of inspirations, here comes the TBS Source V as a starting point for a blend of projects!
